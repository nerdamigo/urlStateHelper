<h1>Nerdamigo's Url State Helper!</h1>
<p>
	When you need to easily persist some level of state such that users sharing urls can easily return to the same
	place, you need Nerdamigo's url state helper.
</p>
<p>
	Registering an object for persistence to the querystring is as simple as a call to <code>$urlStateHelper.register($scope, 'paramName')</code>.
	A property is added to $scope, and until the $scope is $destroyed, the object will persist.
</p>
<p>
	Any <em>external</em> changes to the url (think back/forward) cause an <code>$urlStateHelperExternalChange</code> event to be broadcast from $rootScope
</p>
